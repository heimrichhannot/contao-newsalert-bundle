## Developers

### Add topic source

To add a topic source, your topics class needs to implement the `NewsTopicInterface` and has to be registered as service with the `hh.newsalert.topic_source` tag.

### Notification center tokens
ContaoNewsalertBundle uses Notification Center for e-mail sending. Following tokens are added to `news_posted` type (in addition to the default ones): 

Tag                                   | Description
--------------------------------------|-----------
##huh_newsalert_topic_recipient##      | Emailaddress of the subscriber
##huh_newsalert_news_headline##        | Title of the news for which newsalert is triggered
##huh_newsalert_news_subheadline##     | SUbheadline of the news for which newsalert is triggered
##huh_newsalert_news_teaser##          | Teaser text of the news article
##huh_newsalert_news_content##         | Article content
##huh_newsalert_news_url##             | Relative url to the article
##huh_newsalert_recipient_topics##     | The intersection of news topics and subscribed topics of the receiver
##huh_newsalert_recipient_topic_count##| The the number of topics from ##hh_newsalert_recipient_topics##
##huh_newsalert_opt_out_html##         | A list of all recipients topics and the corresponding unsubscribe links in html format (Topic: Link)
##huh_newsalert_opt_out_text##         | Same list as above, but textonly
##huh_newsalert_year##                 | The current year
##huh_newsalert_root_url##             | Root url

### Hooks

Name                     | Arguments                                            | Expected return value | Description
-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------
huh_newsalert_customToken |NewsModel $objArticle, array $arrTokens, DC_Table $dc | $arrTokens            | Hook to add custom tokens or manipulate existing ones. Don't forget to register them via your config.php file.

### Frontend autocompletion
We recommend [Chosen](https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) to add a search field to the topic select element. It's already used by Contao in the backend.

### Commands

Name              | Options                              | Description 
------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------
huh:newsalert:send|--limit=0: Max number of news articles|Checks for unsend newsalert.

### Setup triggger

You have 3 options:

Option | Description
-------|------------
poorManCron|Poor man cron is the contao own cronjob system. You can choose the intervall in the module settings.
cronJob|You can setup your own cronjob. Just trigger the send command (see Commands)
onSubmit|Trigger newsalert for a news, which is saved. This is **not** recommend, because the onsubmit event is triggered before saving! So the article may not be finished when event is triggered!

## Todo
* use caching for speed improvements?
* serverside topic validation
* cleanup function
    * find duplicated
    * find non-available topics
* Module selection for newsalert onsubmit
